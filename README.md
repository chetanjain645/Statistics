Statistics is the library for python which have powerful distributions of statistics. 

  - Use in data mining.
  - Use in plotting graph for guassian and binomial distribution.
  - Use to calculate the mean, standard deviation, probability distribution function, add two distribution together.

# Why we use Python?
As we know Python is an interpreted language and hence is slow as compared to C++, the most popular language for sports programming. We still decided to use Python because the software development can happen at a much faster pace and it is much easier to test various software designs and APIs as coding them out takes no time. However, keeping the need of the users in mind, we will shift to C++ backend, which will happen quickly as we would be required to just translate the tested code rather than writing it from scratch, after a few releases with APIs available for all the languages.

# Features!

  - The package have two distribution till now.
    - Guassian and binomial distribution.
  - More distribution are in development mode.    
  - The package is made in python.
    - Used Math for calculation and matplotlib for plotting distribution graph.     

Package or library is a collection of logical related classes, functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code.
We can reuse code whenever we want from the library. We don't have to write it again. A library can be installed from the python package manager like pip (preferred installer program) or conda.

### Installation

Statistics require PIP manager to install it in your computer.

Install the dependencies and start coding.

```sh
$ cd statistics
$ pip install .
```
